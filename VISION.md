# Django React Platform - Frontend Vision

## 🎯 Project Philosophy

**Vision**: A clean, maintainable freelance instructor platform that's both enterprise-ready and AI-agent friendly.

**Core Principles**:
1. **Page-centric architecture** - Each feature lives in its own page folder
2. **Gradual complexity** - Start simple, enhance systematically 
3. **AI-friendly structure** - Clear patterns that agents can understand and modify
4. **Learning-oriented** - Every decision is documented and traceable
5. **Production-ready MVP** - Robust but not over-engineered

## 🏗️ Architecture Decisions

### **Folder Structure Philosophy**
- `pages/` - Main navigation hub, each feature is self-contained
- `components/` - Shared/reusable building blocks
- `contexts/` - React state management (keeping it simple)
- `services/` - API calls and external integrations
- Documentation in every folder for AI context

### **Technology Choices**
- **React** - Component-based UI
- **Context API** - State management (no Redux complexity)
- **Custom CSS** - Full control over styling (no UI library dependency)
- **Axios** - API communication with JWT handling
- **React Router** - Clean URL navigation

### **Design System**
- **Apple-inspired** - Clean, premium, minimal design
- **Consistent spacing** - 8px grid system
- **Color palette**: 
  - Background: `#F8F9FA`
  - Cards: `#FFFFFF` 
  - Text: `#1A1A1A`
  - Accent: `#007AFF`
  - Gray: `#6C757D`

## 🎨 User Experience Goals

1. **Clean URLs** - `/login`, `/register`, `/dashboard` (no ugly hashes)
2. **Responsive design** - Works on all devices
3. **Fast loading** - Minimal dependencies, optimized assets
4. **Accessible** - Proper labels, keyboard navigation
5. **Intuitive** - Apple-like simplicity and polish

## 🔄 Development Workflow

1. **Document first** - Every change gets explained
2. **Migrate gradually** - One page/component at a time
3. **Test incrementally** - Verify each step works
4. **AI-friendly commits** - Clear commit messages and structure

## 🎯 Current Status

**MVP Phase**: Authentication system complete
- ✅ Login/Register with clean URLs
- ✅ JWT token handling
- ✅ Protected routes
- ✅ Apple-style design

**Next Phase**: Enhanced structure and form validation
- 🔄 Page-centric reorganization
- 🔄 Component library extraction
- 📋 Form enhancement with validation
- 📋 Error handling improvements
